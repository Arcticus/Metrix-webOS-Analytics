<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="smallText">
At webOSroundup and Syntactix (hereby known as WORX) we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Metrix Library offered by WORX. 
It describes the application information that we collect, the purposes for which we use such information, and your choices regarding our use of it. 
The steps we take to protect your application information and how you can review and correct your application information are also covered here. 
By integrating our software into your application, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.  
In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process information here on
the privacy page. 
It is the developers’ responsibility if choosing to implement this feature to follow the guidelines set forth by Palm.  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="Contact.aspx">contact us</a>.

<p class="smallText">If a developer is using Metrix, it means that they are a good dev and are working hard to make the app the best it can possibly be. From a privacy perspective, Metrix does not collect any specific user information. Some of our services may optionally allow you to submit personal information, but these situations will always be
voluntary. Simply put, Metrix only collects information that is about your phone, not you as a person. Out of the box Metrix tracks what carrier you use, what country you are in, and 
whether or not you use Metrix enabled applications.</p>
<p class="smallText">It is worth noting that Metrix enables developers to customize what is being tracked. These custom analytics are completely the responsibility of the developer and
are not controlled in any way by WORX. However, all developers who use Metrix are required to follow the <a href="https://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1815">
application distribution program agreement</a> developed by Palm. These guidelines have been designed by Palm to prevent the tracking of sensitive without the knowledge and consent of the user.
However, WORX cannot be held responsible if a developer fails to follow these guidelines.</p>

<p class="smallText">In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

<p class="smallText"><strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you integrate the Metrix Library into your application, you control when and what information is provided to us such as but not limited to device specific data, user usage statistics, etc.  We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other WORX services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</p>
<p class="smallText">We use this information to improve the quality of our service, including for providing number of users and tracking user trends, such but not limited to how many people on which carriers using what device.  WORX also uses this information in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads appropriate for the developer community.</p>
<p class="smallText"><strong>User communications</strong> – When you send email or other communications to WORX, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
<p class="smallText"><strong>User data</strong> – Metrix collects very basic information about the user. Generally speaking, this is phone specific (i.e. locale, carrier, etc) rather than personal information about the user. However, with custom analytics it is possible to track user information (such as GPS for locale aware apps). In these cases it is expected that you will follow <a href="https://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1815">Palm's guidelines</a> regarding user information and notify the user when necessary. WORX is not responsible if these guidelines are not followed.</p>

<p class="smallText">WORX only processes application information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
<li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our products;</li>
<li>Protecting the rights or property of WORX or our developers; and</li>
<li>Developing new services. 

</ul>

<h2>Choices for Developer information</h2>

<p class="smallText">When you sign up for Metrix you agree to the terms as stated in this privacy policy. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>

<p class="smallText">If we propose to use this information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>

<h2>Information sharing</h2>

<p class="smallText">WORX only shares application  information with other companies or individuals outside of WORX in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive application information.</li>
<li>We provide such information to our affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing application information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of WORX, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </li>
</ul>

<p class="smallText">If WORX becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any information involved in such transactions and provide notice before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  </p>

<p class="smallText">We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-app specific information, such as but not limited to the number of users who have a particular service provider. Such information does not identify you or your application.</p>

<h2>Information security</h2>

<p class="smallText">We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store application data.</p>

<p class="smallText">We restrict access to information to WORX employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<h2>Data integrity</h2>

<p class="smallText">WORX processes application information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the application information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the application information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their application information whenever necessary.</p>

<h2>Accessing and updating information</h2>

<p class="smallText">When you use WORX services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p class="smallText">WORX regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or WORX’s treatment of application  information by contacting us through theMetrix Library website.</p>

<p class="smallText">When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is WORX’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of application data that cannot be resolved between WORX and an individual.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p class="smallText">Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
