        Metrix is a suite of tools designed for every <strong>webOS developer</strong>. 
        It is easy to install, easy to use, will blow your mind in its usefullness, and did we mention <strong>you can use it for free</strong>? 
        Aside from a full analytics package, developers can communicate with their users with customizable bulletins, troubleshoot 
        difficult issues with remote debugging <em>(coming soon)</em>, and much much more.

        At its most basic level, Metrix is an analytics suite for your webOS applications. In reality it is much more than that. 
        In addition to letting you know how many times your app has been downloaded, or how often it is actually used by those who purchased it, 
        you can create your own metrics and learn how many times a song has been downloaded, a script has been run, or how many times a player 
        has beaten level five. It is completely up to you how metrix will help you take control of your app.

        Let's say you have an important announcement to make...maybe you have a sale going on with your other apps, or you have a huge update coming
        and you want to show your users the change log. You could build something into your app that lets you talk to your users once per update, or
        you could install Metrix and update them anytime you need to with a full HTML display. Pretty sweet huh?

        So...you have a really nasty bug. You are getting emails from some users about it, but you have not been able to reproduce it. Sound familiar?
        Don't worry. It happens to all of us. If you have Metrix, though, it doesn't have to be a big deal. You can contact one of the users and 
        quickly setup remote debugging which will allow you to see exactly what is happening on that user's device. Poof! Mystery solved.

        Wanna know the best thing about Metrix? We are just getting started. We are constantly working on more and more goodies to include in
        the library, and we have several just around the corner. And just in case I forgot to mention...Metrix is free! While we are testing
        things out and getting all our ducks in a row all of our features (including our premium stuff) is completely free. So get in while
        the gettin' is good!
